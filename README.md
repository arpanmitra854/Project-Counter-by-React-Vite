# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.



Hooks in React :-

Hooks are special functions in React that let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

Basically we use hooks when we need to change the value in many places on the UI

in this project using hook we got two values, one is the default value of the state 'counter'(it can be a variable) & second is the function 'setState' which updates the state when the button is clicked


State in React :-

State in React is a built-in object that holds data specific to a component and allows the component to re-render when the data changes.
